- The difference $\pmb{u}-\pmb{v}$ is a vector if both vectors belong to the same vector space.
- The distance between $\pmb{u}$ and $\pmb{v}$ is defined as $||\pmb{u}-\pmb{v}||$

- There are two other properties that a norm must have before it can properly be called a norm:
	- When a vector is scaled by a scalar, its norm must scale with the magnitude of the scalar.
	- The vector space must yield the triangle inequality under the norm, i.e., the shortest distance between two points is the norm of the vector joining them.

- Summarized *norm properties*:
	- Nonnegativity: $0 \le ||\pmb{u}||$
	- Nullness: $||\pmb{u}|| = 0\leftrightarrow ||\pmb{u}|| =0$ 0
	- Scaling: $||\alpha\pmb{u}|| = |\alpha|||\pmb{u}||$
	- Triangle inequality: $||\pmb{u}+\pmb{v}|| \le ||\pmb{u}||+||\pmb{v}||$
