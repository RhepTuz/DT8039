# Properties of FT
- Takes in a function and outputs a function.

- A flat function (i.e. a function like y=1) as an input for FT outputs a *direc distribution*

- $$\frac{sinc(\omega)}{\omega}$$ 
	- increasing $\omega$ to infinity creates a *direc distribution*

- (Self proclaimed by Josef) Accordian principle: if you increase in one domain, you get a concentraion in another.

## Convolution

- $\mathscr{F}(f * g)(\omega)=2\pi F(\omega)G(\omega)$ 

- Star (convolution) * in one domain translates to dot (multiplication) . in another domain


- Shit holds for DST and Fourier coefficents üëç
