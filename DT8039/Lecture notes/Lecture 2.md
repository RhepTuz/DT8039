# Discrete Images and Hilbert Spaces 

- In order to be a vector space the members must obey two rules:
	- **Scaling with scalar** is defined and the space is closed under this operation, also called vector scaling.
	- **Addition** is defined and the space is closed under this operation, also called vector addition.
- No limit of the amount of dimensions.
- Color is not the only way we gather information, shape and texture is also very important sources to gather context.
